# Present

Main ideas / purpose of tool

- will revolve around md

- A quick way to present md files

- make a version of `less` but for md files

- Have code execution of code snippets inside the md files

- should not expect to be a text editor, this is focused of viewing

- use charm tools to make the tool pretty and easy to deploy , specially the md
  rendering

- This is a simpler version of a bigger idea i had of a book that can be
  accessed through ssh, if this works then it can be easily accommodated to
  create a book
