	*Identifier (PID), state, priority, program counter (PC), memory pointers, context data, I/O status information, accounting informaiton*
4. Find Average Access Time
	*Avg Access Time = (T1)(Hit Ratio) + (T2 + T1)(Miss ratio*
	*T2 is slower than T1*
	*Miss Ratio = 1 - Hit Ratio*
	*The Higher the Hit Ratio is the closer the AMAT is going to be to the Access time for level 1 (T1)** 
5. Find parameters of a hypothetical computer system:
	1. Number of different OPCodes
	2. Memory size in bits
	3. Memory Range
	4. Data Range
